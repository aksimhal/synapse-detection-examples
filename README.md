# Probabilistic Synapse Detection examples 

Welcome! In this repository, you'll find code to analyze array tomography data as presented at SfN 2022. This repository contains a couple things: 

- Generic synapse detection example in python (recommended) 
- Generic synapse detection example in MATLAB 
- Example array tomography data that you can use 
- Notebook containing the code used to generate the data presented in the SfN 2022 poster, along with the poster itself. 

To run the synapse detection notebook in python, you have to install the synapse detection package first. Installation instructions are listed here: https://aksimhal.github.io/SynapseAnalysis/SynapseDetection. Please email me if you run into any errors or have any questions. 

The original paper proposing this method is here: [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005493](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005493) and a paper showing its usage in a larger study is here: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50240-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50240-x). Please cite both papers if this code is useful for your project.
